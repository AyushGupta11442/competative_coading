this is the implementation of binary tree in array implementation 


finding the left and right son

so we can arrange the array  in two cases and to find there left and right child 

case 1 (0—n-1) 

if (say)father=p; 
then left_son=(2*p)+1; 
and right_son=(2*p)+2;

Case 2: 1—n

if (say)father=p; 
then left_son=(2*p); 
and right_son=(2*p)+1;
